# Pokemon Finder App

A simple Pokemon search application that allows users to look up Pokemon and view their details including stats, types, and abilities.

## About This Project

This project served as my introduction to .NET development and C# programming, combined with modern frontend technologies. It's a full-stack implementation focused on learning fundamental concepts of both backend and frontend development, helping me get familiar with the .NET ecosystem and web development workflow.

## Features

- **Pokemon Search**: Search for Pokemon by name
- **Detailed Information**: View Pokemon stats including height, weight, base experience, and ID
- **Type Display**: See Pokemon types with color-coded badges
- **Abilities**: View Pokemon abilities with styled indicators
- **Clean Interface**: Simple, user-friendly design with responsive layout

3. Run the development server
4. Open your browser and start searching for Pokemon!

## Technologies Used

### Backend (.NET/C#)
- **ASP.NET Core** - Web framework for building the API
- **C#** - Primary programming language for backend logic
- **MVC Architecture** - Model-View-Controller pattern for organized code structure
- **Pokemon Service** - Custom service layer for Pokemon data handling

### Frontend (Next.js/React)
- **Next.js 14** - React framework for the user interface
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **shadcn/ui** - Modern component library built on Radix UI
- **React Hook Form + Zod** - Form handling and validation

### Development Tools
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting platform
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing and optimization

## Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand:
- **.NET Core fundamentals** and C# programming concepts
- **Full-stack development** with separate frontend and backend
- **API design** and service layer architecture
- **Modern React patterns** with TypeScript
- **Component-based UI development** with reusable design systems
- **Responsive web design** and CSS frameworks
